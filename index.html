Tema loves cinnabon rolls — buns with cinnabon and chocolate in the shape of a "snail".

Cinnabon rolls come in different sizes and are square when viewed from above. The most delicious part of a roll is the chocolate, which is poured in a thin layer over the cinnabon roll in the form of a spiral and around the bun, as in the following picture:

For a cinnabon roll of size n
, the length of the outer side of the square is n
, and the length of the shortest vertical chocolate segment in the central part is one.

Formally, the bun consists of two dough spirals separated by chocolate. A cinnabon roll of size n+1
 is obtained from a cinnabon roll of size n
 by wrapping each of the dough spirals around the cinnabon roll for another layer.

It is important that a cinnabon roll of size n
 is defined in a unique way.

Tema is interested in how much chocolate is in his cinnabon roll of size n
. Since Tema has long stopped buying small cinnabon rolls, it is guaranteed that n≥4
.

Answer this non-obvious question by calculating the total length of the chocolate layer.

Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer t
 (1≤t≤105
) — the number of test cases.

The following t
 lines describe the test cases.

Each test case is described by a single integer n
 (4≤n≤109
) — the size of the cinnabon roll.

Output
Output t
 integers. The i
-th of them should be equal to the total length of the chocolate layer in the i
-th test case.
